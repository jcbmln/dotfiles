# Jacob Malone's Dotfiles

This is just a couple custom themes and plugins for `oh-my-zsh` plus some rc files and scripts I find useful.

## Installation

You can install my dotfiles using curl:

```sh
sh -c "`curl -fsSL https://gitlab.com/jcbmln/dotfiles/raw/master/install.sh`"
```

or, using wget:

```sh
sh -c "`wget -O - --no-check-certificate https://gitlab.com/jcbmln/dotfiles/raw/master/install.sh`"
```
